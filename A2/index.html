            <h3>Which Countries are Most Vulnerable to Terrorist Attacks?</h3>
            <p>
                Most of the terrorist attacks were clustered in Asia. In the begining, only a few asian cities had a small chance of a terrorist attack. But since 1985, the number of terrorist attacks in East Asia became very frequent, with India, Pakistan and Afghanistan being the worst hit. Also, the cities in these three countries where the terrorist attacks took place were very close together. Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and other southeast asian countries also experienced frequent terrorist attacks. Japan and China were relatively safe. Australia, being in Oceania, had the least number of terrorist attacks in recent years.

            <h3>Are Terrorist Activities under control?</h3>
            <p>
                Since 1986, terrorist attacks with large-scale casualties have continued to increase. In 1995, the number of casualties caused by terrorist attacks exceeded 10,000 for the first time, and then declined slightly. Then it began to gradually increase in 2003 and reached an all-time high in 2015. After entering the 21st century, the casualties caused by terrorist activities have become more serious.
